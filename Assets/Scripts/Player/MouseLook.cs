/* 
SUMMARY:
    This script controls the camera movement, which is controlled by the mouse

CODE OVERVIEW:
    If the mouse is moved on the x axis (side to side)
        Rotate player object around the y axis
    If the mouse is moved on the y axis (up and down)
        Rotate camera object around the x axis
        Limit the rotation of the camera to 180 degress (this is known as clamping)

        // Vector3.up essentially is the Y axis and mouseX is how much the player is rotated around the Y axis
